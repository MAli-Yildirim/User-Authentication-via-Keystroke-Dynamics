# User-Authentication-via-Keystroke-Dynamics

This is a python project which use following libraries;

-PyQt5
-numpy
-time
-sklearn


Make sure to download necessary libraries before starting 

The main goal of this project is increasing the password security of users.
We are creating user models from key typings and we are using them onto machine learning algorithm.
2 method is used.
For password security i am using oneclass-svm to detect anomalies.
For comparison with other users svm algorithm is used but their passwords must match.


I created a account database in the account folder and it holds 3 example users.

Whichs are;

ID:        maliyil  - maliyil2 - seymaa
Password:  yildirim - yildirim - yildirim
Data Size: 111      - 100      - 230

The first one is encryted as a rythim of super mario for extra security
The second one has mine biometric data there are no rythim
The Third one is belong to my sisters' biometric data without rythim 

                        !!!Warning!!!
